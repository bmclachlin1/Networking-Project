# Networking-Project

In this project, I developed client and server programs that implement the alternating bit protocol. The following list of things are supported.

1) Connection Establishment
2) Data transfer using alternating bit protocol
3) Error recovery

The program sends encoded text eight characters at a time along with a sequence number representing request or acknowledgment.
